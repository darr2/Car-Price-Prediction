# Car-Price-Prediction

The objective of this project is to predict the price of a car, given features, such as
make, model, horsepower, number of cylinders, transmission type, number of doors, and city and highway mpg.
This is a supervised learning problem, which uses a regression model to fit and predict the data.

### Data_Story.ipynb
This notebook contains exploratory data analysis and data storytelling.
Here, you will find insights from the given dataset and data visualizations, 
such as pricing distributions correlation plots.

### Inferencial_Statistics.ipynb
This notebook covers statistical findings, such as the mean, median, and standard
deviation pricing. It also includes correlation analysis of pricing with respect
to engine horsepower and miles per gallon.

### Machine_Learning.ipynb
This notebook contains testing and evaluation of various machine learning models:
Linear Regression (including Ridge Regession and Lasso Regression),
Random Forest Regression, K Nearest Neighbors Regression,
and Support Vector Machine Regression.
